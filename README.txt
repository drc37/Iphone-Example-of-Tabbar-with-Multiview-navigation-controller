I put together this example as a proof of concept for doing a tabbar with multiple tabs.  Inside one tab, you have a splitview.  And the split view uses multiple view controllers, one for line item in the splitview tableview.

UITabbar
 - UISplitViewController
 - - UIViewController
 - - UIViewController
